# Medicine Reminder App: AI-Driven Healthcare Management

## Overview

The **Medicine Reminder App** simplifies the process of managing medication schedules by integrating cutting-edge technologies like **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Gemini AI**. This app helps users maintain medication adherence by automating the process of setting reminders based on prescriptions, ensuring users never miss a dose.

## Problem Solved

Many users struggle with keeping track of their medication schedules, leading to missed doses and potential health risks. Our app solves this by automating the scheduling of reminders, either by reading prescriptions or through voice input, reducing the chances of human error.

## Features

### 1. Two Input Methods
- **Voice Input via Gemini AI**: Users can set reminders hands-free by speaking to the app in natural language.
- **Manual Input**: Users can manually enter medication details (name, dosage, frequency) and set reminders.

### 2. Real-Time Notifications
- **Buzzing Alarms and Voice Alerts**: Reminders are delivered through audio notifications to ensure the user takes the medication on time.

### 3. Prescription Parsing
- The app reads and parses prescriptions in real-time to identify:
  - Medicine names
  - Dosages
  - Methods of intake (oral, injection, etc.)
  - Frequency

### 4. Seamless AI Interaction
- Natural two-way interaction with **Gemini AI** to set reminders, making it user-friendly and eliminating the need for typing.

## Technology Stack
- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For designing a modern, responsive user interface.
- **Gemini AI**: To enable voice interaction and automate reminder setting.

## How It Works
1. **Voice Input**: Users can speak to set reminders, and the app will process the input using Gemini AI.
2. **Manual Input**: Users can also manually input their medication schedule if preferred.
3. **Real-Time Alerts**: Users will receive buzzing and voice reminders to take their medications.
